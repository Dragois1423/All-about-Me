<h2 id="MR">About My Resume</h2>
    <p> My resume is usually composed of three sections: <b>Work Experience</b>, <b>Personal Projects</b>, and <b>Volunteering</b></p>
        <pre font-size="14px"> <b> <u> 1. Work Experience </u> </b> </pre>
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif;""> <b> a) McDonald's: </b> McDonald's is a globally recognized fast food restaurant, which prides on its ability to consistently meet the demands of customers' expectations of fast and quality meals. As a crew member, I collaborated with my peers in order to maintain the excellent standards that customers expect. Whether it'd be becoming the cashier, janitor or the cook for the night, I would communicate between my peers and myself to ensure the restaurant not only is sanitary but also feels welcoming for the customers. That is, there was no single task that I was designated to accomplish because my role as a crew member was to identify and assist any areas that were lacking. </p>
